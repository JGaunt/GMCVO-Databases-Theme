# GMCVO Databases Sub-Theme for Drupal 7 Using Porto
An experimental sub-theme of Porto that relies on CSS classes being assigned to the appropriate blocks. 
Basic knowledge of Drupal themes and CSS are required to fully understand this theme as the blocks require a little coding to get the right classes but the majority can be copied and pasted from the README.TXT file and edited with your own content. Use the README.TXT in the subtheme's files for in depth explanations on each section of the theme.
Only tested with the Porto theme currently.
